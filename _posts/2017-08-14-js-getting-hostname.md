I was looking for ways of getting the hostname part of a given url. For my surprise, JS had a built-in feature to do that, as long as the link is within a **< a >** tag. So we have to create a temporary tag to hold the link, extract the hostname and get rid of it when weâ€™re done.

```js
// JS function

$(document).ready(function() {
  $linkField = $('[name="form-link"]');
  $sourceField = $('[name="form-source"]');
  $linkField.keypress(function() {
    $tempA = document.createElement('a');
    $tempA.href = $linkField.val();
    $sourceField.val($tempA.hostname);
    $tempA.remove();
  });
});
```
