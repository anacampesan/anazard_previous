I started this very specific blog project a while ago, as you can see by my Github contributions. However, my will of having a website exists since my first 10 years of life. I created a bunch of HTML files using Win Notepad and FrontPage, dived into Macromedia Dreamweaver (top-notch at the time), wrote some lines of code in Javascript, came up with a couple characteristic WEB 1.0 websites about things I used to like (pretty much Dragon Ball Z and Counter-Strike), took a web design course when I was 13, went to a couple computer introductory classes with my mom... I did a lot for a 5th grade girl.

Noticed that I didn't mention any server side language until now, as I was introduced to it in my first year at university. Up to that point of my life, dynamic web pages were a complete land of unknownness for me. I then fired up the server and had the workflow of my application being changed according to the state of some variables. **That was pure magic!** Technology had become limitless.

```php
<?php
$name = 'Ana';
?>

<h1>Welcome, <?php echo $name; ?>!</h1>
<!-- Yeah, this was magic for the not so little 18-year-old @anazard -->
```
