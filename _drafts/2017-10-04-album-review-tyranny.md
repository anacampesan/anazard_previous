'Don’t try to show your friends, they won’t like it'. I couldn’t describe Tyranny better than this commentary from Amazon.ca. This album is simply an awesome mixing of experimental music, 80’s, guitars, drum machines and synthesizers, all that a common The Strokes fan don’t expect to find. I say this because Julian’s albums may sound totally apart from the simple and based on chords progression music The Strokes used to play.

Well, without much explanation, it’s an amazing album as well as in concert. Maybe you find yourself in the same situation as me when I first listened to it: I downloaded, didn’t give much attention, liked only a song, left behind. Because I had bought a ticket for the show, I tried to try again (going to a concert you barely know the songs is awful). And then I liked it. A lot. I listened to the same album for three weeks before the concert, and it was one of the best decisions I’ve made! If you didn’t like it at the first time, give it another try. The album was well produced as well as the instrumental parts. Some interesting parts are the use of vocoder (the effect to modify vocals like in Instant Crush), and the presence of really nice transitions between bridges, verses and chorus. Cult Records’ main band may disappoint if you’re looking for something like The Strokes. However, in the same way that happens to Serj Tankian, not always changing the style from the original band is something bad. Quite the contrary; Tyranny is my favorite album of 2014!
Take Me In Your Army
The first song of this album is a cool ballad with synths, there are also falsettos like in The Comedown Machine.
Crunch Punch
A little more animated and with a chromatic guitar riff, makes Julian reach great tones in the chorus. Also has nice bridges.
M.Utually A.Ssured D.Estruction
The heavier song of the album, no doubts. Kinda punk, shorter and has nice contratempos.
Human Sadness
One of the first songs to be released. Almost 11 minutes long, starts with synths and ends up with an awesome guitar solo. Julian used vocoder, and it’s very interesting to observe the effects in a concert. Some people say this song is related to Julian’s father’s death.
Where No Eagles Fly
Another chromatic riff, one of the best tracks of this album. Aggressive chorus and cool bridges.
Father Electricity
This song has one of the most sticky licks of the world (after 'Who likes that bad idea? You'). One of the songs you look forward to a certain part to come. Reminds me of Brazilian rhythms.
Johan Von Bronx
Initially introduced as 'Ego', this is my favorite track in the album. Has synths and nice solos. Played by the band in Lollapalooza Brazil 2014.
Business Dog
This is the song I mentioned I liked at first. The riff has contratempos and it reminds me of a Joe Satriani’s song. Sounds punk and distorted.
Xerox
Calm concert opening song. Has an alien riff (listen, and you’ll understand).
Dare I Care
Another one with a different beat, which reminds me of Serj Tankian’s influences. However, has a chorus that sounds like One Way Trigger (the closest this album gets to The Strokes). People say it’s a message towards them…
Nintendo Blood
Almost all characterized by synths, sounds like a platform game like Megaman.
Off To War…
Maybe the only one I don’t listen to so often, very calm and reminds me of Elect The Dead by Serj Tankian.
Best ones: Johan Von Bronx, Where No Eagles Fly, Human Sadness
