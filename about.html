        Welcome to my website. I'm a Brazilian software and web developer currently based in Montreal, Canada.

        This is meant to be a place on which I intend to expose programming tutorials, comments, music reviews and anything else that might come up. When I first thought of writing a blog, the main idea was writing reviews of every single CD I had back home. Then, I actually thought it would be a waste if I didn't also write about programming languages and technologies in general as a contribution, especially having acquired most of my knowledge from the online community.

        I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development from FATEC (Brazil) in 2016, and did part of my program at York University (Canada). In Toronto, I studied mostly academic English and Virtual Reality.

        My interests range from music (guitar, drums, production, novelties) to technology (programming languages, computers, microcontrollers, open-source), including even subway systems all around the world.
