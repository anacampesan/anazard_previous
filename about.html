        Welcome to my website. I'm a Brazilian software developer based in Montréal, Canada.

        This is where I intend to post thoughts, tutorials, music reviews and anything else that might come up in my mind. When I first thought of writing a blog, the main idea consisted of writing reviews on every single CD I had back home. Then I actually thought it would be a total waste if I didn't also write about programming languages and technologies in general as a contribution, especially having acquired most of my knowledge from the online community.

        I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development from FATEC (Brazil) in 2016, and did part of my program at York University (Toronto). During this exchange, I studied mostly academic English and Virtual Reality.

        Back in Canada, I now call Montréal home, fell in love with the city, and have been learning French since then.

        Roughly speaking, my interests range from music (guitar, drums, production, novelties) to technology (programming languages, computers, microcontrollers, open-source), including even subway systems all around the world. Last but not least, Tim Hortons is a must.
