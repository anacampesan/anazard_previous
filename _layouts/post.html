          Ever wanted to dive into the constantly-evolving world of Front-End frameworks? Felt quite lost not knowing where to start? Looks like your chance to learn <strong>Angular</strong> <small>(aka Angular 2)</small>, which is currently the hottest and most sofisticated technology for web development, has finally come! Its final version officially came out in January, making Angular a great bet for projects within the next couple years.

          <h2>It is free</h2>
          Nothing quite like spreading the knowledge the internet and communities in general give us, eh? With this idea in mind, <a href="http://twitter.com/anazard">@anazard</a> (me) invites anyone interested in learning, either professional or enthusiast developer.

          <h2>How will it work?</h2>
          Roughly, it will be an online workshop held through Google Hangouts (athough suggestions for other platforms are welcome). We will see the basics of Angular, do a few exercises, and work on an exciting Pokédex fed by the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokéAPI</a>.
          <br>
          We will cover everything needed in order to take the first steps with the framework, including (but not limited to):
          <ul>
            <li>Modules and components</li>
            <li>Requests and services</li>
            <li>Routing</li>
            <li>Command line interface</li>
          </ul>
